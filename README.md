# Restoid

A modern, root-based Android backup tool powered by [`restic`](https://github.com/restic/restic/).

Restoid gives you control over your app backups through a clean and simple user interface. It's built for users who want robust, encrypted, and deduplicated backups.

## 🚧 Project Status

**This is an early beta release.** The application is functional, but you may encounter bugs. The codebase is a work-in-progress and is undergoing active development and refactoring. Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are highly encouraged!

## ✨ Features

* **Restic-Powered**: Leverages the speed, security, and efficiency of `restic` for deduplicated and encrypted backups.
* **Selective App Backup**: Choose exactly which user-installed applications you want to back up.
* **Full Control Over What You Back Up**: Granularly select what to include for each app: APK files, user data, device-protected data, external/OBB/media files.
* **Flexible Repository Management**: Create and manage backup repositories on your device's local storage, SD card, or mounted drives.
* **Snapshot Management**: Easily browse backup snapshots, view details of what was backed up, and forget old snapshots.
* **Flexible Restore**: Restore entire apps or just specific parts (like only app data).
* **Downgrade Protection**: Prevents you from accidentally restoring an older app version over a newer one (can be overridden).
* **Zero-Hassle Dependencies**: Automatically downloads and manages the `restic` binary for your device's architecture.

## ⚡ Beyond Local Backups: Sync with Syncthing!

While Restoid creates local backup repositories, its true power shines when combined with tools like [**Syncthing**](https://syncthing.net/).

You can set up your repository in a folder that is synchronized by Syncthing. This allows you to automatically and securely transfer your encrypted Android backups to your server, laptop, or any other device in your private network. It's a perfect, decentralized setup for keeping your data safe and under your control.

## ⚠️ Requirements

* **Root Access**: This is non-negotiable. Restoid requires elevated privileges to access app data directories. It uses `libsu` for robust root command execution.
* **Android Version**: Minimum SDK 33 (Android 13).

## 📲 Download & Installation

You have two options to get the app:

### Choose Your Flavor

Restoid comes in two flavors:

*   **Bundled**: Includes the pre-compiled `restic` binary. The APK file is larger, but you don't need to download anything else after installation. It works out of the box.
*   **Vanilla**: Does not include the `restic` binary. The APK is smaller, but you will need to download `restic` from within the app (**Settings** -> **Download**) before you can use it.

1.  **Obtainium**

    > **Note:** You'll need to check the "Include prereleases" option, as the app hasn't hit a stable `v1.0.0` release yet.

2.  **GitHub Releases**
    You can also just grab the latest APK file directly from the [**GitHub Releases page**](https://github.com/hddq/restoid/releases).
    > **Note:** You'll need to manually check for updates and install new APKs when using this method.
